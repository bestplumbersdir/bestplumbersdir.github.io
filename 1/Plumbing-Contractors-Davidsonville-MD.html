Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
