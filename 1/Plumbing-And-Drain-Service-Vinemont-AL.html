<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
