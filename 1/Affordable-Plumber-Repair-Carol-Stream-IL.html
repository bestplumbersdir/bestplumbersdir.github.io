Homes integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
