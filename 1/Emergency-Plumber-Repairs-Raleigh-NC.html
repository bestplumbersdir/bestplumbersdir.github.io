<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Raleigh NC</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, usually salt. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very percentage of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low salt" by the Fda.</p>
