<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water system and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and hard to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also incredibly resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively utilized pipe product for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
