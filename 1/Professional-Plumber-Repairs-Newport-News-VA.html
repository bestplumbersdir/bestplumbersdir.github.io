Acids are substances that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Co2 will potentially contribute to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
