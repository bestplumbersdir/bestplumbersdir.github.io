<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
