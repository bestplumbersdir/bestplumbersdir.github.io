<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
