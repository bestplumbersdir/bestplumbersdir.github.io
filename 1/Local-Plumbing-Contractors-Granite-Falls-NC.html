Even more, it should be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer specs, and engineering standards for the kind of unit to be used.</p>

While it may appear like a job worth handling, there are several reasons to prevent taking a DIY approach to a sewer line repair project and instead pick to work with a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
