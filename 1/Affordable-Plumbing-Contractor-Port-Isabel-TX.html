<h3>Water Heater Repair in Port Isabel Texas</h2>
<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
