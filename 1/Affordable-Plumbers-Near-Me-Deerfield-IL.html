<p>Do you discover that you have flaky or dry skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg smell?

Backflow Preventer definition: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to perform site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a prospective or actual cross-connection risk on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays.
