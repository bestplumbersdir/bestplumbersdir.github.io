Checking the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be serious issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home should have water. This opts for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a good start if everything is working effectively.</p>
