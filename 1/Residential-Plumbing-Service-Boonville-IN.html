<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line has to do with 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate option to do simply that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
