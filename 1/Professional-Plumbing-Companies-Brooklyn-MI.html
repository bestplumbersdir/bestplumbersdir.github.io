<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.
