<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly simple system, in spite of their value. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your service, where irrigation meets the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep track of the motion of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This ensures that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>

If the line has to do with 40 years of ages and is showing signs of age throughout, definitely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
