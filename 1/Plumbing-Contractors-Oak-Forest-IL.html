Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is incredibly essential. However, you have to make certain your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
