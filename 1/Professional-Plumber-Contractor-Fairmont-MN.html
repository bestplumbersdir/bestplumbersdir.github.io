<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in 2 standard types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the unit.

An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an overview of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
