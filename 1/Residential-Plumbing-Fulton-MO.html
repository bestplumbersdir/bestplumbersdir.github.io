For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to stream backward into city water products.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
