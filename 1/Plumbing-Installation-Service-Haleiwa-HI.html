<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
