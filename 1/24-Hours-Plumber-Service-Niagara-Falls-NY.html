<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
