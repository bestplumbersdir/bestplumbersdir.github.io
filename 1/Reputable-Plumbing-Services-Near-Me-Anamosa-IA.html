<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that certain magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be effective in preventing scale development in difficult water systems. It is really difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well enough explained to allow others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one be reluctant to accept it without some guarantee of efficiency.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than normal (or perhaps more than once), this is an indication you may need a toilet repair or replacement. This could be a sign that the mechanism that flushes needs changed, the water jets are simply not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low. No matter the cause, Vegas Valley Plumbing need to be employed to have a gander at your toilet.</p>
