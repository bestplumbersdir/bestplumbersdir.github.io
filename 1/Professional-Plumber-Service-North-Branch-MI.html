<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You must wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration.

<p>A. Using phosphoric acid generally will help remove them if you have rust areas. If you would like to attempt the gentlest approach perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and safety cautions first!), if that does not do the trick.
