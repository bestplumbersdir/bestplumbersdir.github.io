<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
