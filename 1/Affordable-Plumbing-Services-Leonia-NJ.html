<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Many utility companies add a sulfur substance to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from.
