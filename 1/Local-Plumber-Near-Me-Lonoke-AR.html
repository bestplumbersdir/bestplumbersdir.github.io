<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
