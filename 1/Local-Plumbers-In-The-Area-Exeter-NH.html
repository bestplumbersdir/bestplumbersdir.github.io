<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Exeter NH</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the building is considered to not posture a threat to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
