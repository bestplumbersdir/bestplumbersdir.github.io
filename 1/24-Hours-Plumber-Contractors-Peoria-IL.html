<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
