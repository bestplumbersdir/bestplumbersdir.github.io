<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you should only hire a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may get through a drip leg.</p>
