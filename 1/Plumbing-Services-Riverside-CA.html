<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
