<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every single person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew.

All of individuals I encountered were role models for what a well run service organisation must be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're excellent.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
