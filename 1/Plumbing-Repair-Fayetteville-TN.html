If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a timely way, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code needs stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to accomplish the very same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are added to a fire protection system provided by a potable water supply, increased protection is also required. If you have children, advise them to prevent holding on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
