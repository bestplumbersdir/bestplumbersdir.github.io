Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing supplies repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, as well as cities and towns in the surrounding city.

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
