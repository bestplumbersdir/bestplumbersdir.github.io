A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a danger to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
