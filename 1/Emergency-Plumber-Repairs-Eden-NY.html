<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in two basic types - constant feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the system. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed design is much safer but can be slower to use on large quantities of food waste because you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies an overview of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
