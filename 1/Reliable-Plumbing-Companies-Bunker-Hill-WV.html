<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
