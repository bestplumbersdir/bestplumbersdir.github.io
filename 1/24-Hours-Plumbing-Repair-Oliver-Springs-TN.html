<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Ensure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
