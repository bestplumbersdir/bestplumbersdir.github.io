This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
