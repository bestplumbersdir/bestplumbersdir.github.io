<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust.
