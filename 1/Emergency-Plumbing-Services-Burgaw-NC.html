<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>We utilize both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Since it is long lasting and long lasting, copper is the market standard. We will offer you various choices based upon your budget and choices. PEX piping is a new choice that is flexible, resistant to corrosion, and as much as 75 percent more economical than copper piping.</p>
