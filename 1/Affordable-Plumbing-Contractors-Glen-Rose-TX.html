For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
