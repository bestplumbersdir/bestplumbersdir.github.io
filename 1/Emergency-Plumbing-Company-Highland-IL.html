A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature level or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
