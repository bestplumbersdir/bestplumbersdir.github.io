<h3>When To Call A Plumber Dillon MT</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another product. Replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is important since of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down for many years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Was your house built prior to the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has actually worn away and rotted throughout the years. Older pipes can cause significant leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
