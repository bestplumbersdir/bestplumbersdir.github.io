<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system.

Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.
