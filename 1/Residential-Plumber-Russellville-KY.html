Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a safe and steady  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally channelled somewhere else to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to blocking because there simply isn't enough a high adequate flow to flush out the debris.</p>
