<p>No, you must NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Bow NH</h3>
<p>We all experience a clogged drain at some time. You can attempt to take matters into your hands by using everyday products, such as a plunger, a coat wall mount, or a snake. Some homeowners will try to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, specifically if you are dealing with a small drain clog. Nevertheless, they are generally temporary fixes that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of the clog, we may use a variety of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp port and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
