Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.

<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC concentrates on the installation and repair of residential and commercial natural gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services. If your commercial residential or commercial property currently has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it evaluated annually by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List We will notify you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
