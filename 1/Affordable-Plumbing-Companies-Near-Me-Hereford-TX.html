Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
