<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
