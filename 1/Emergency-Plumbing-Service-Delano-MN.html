Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
