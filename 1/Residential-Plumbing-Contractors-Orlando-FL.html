<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger considerable problems and damage-- specifically common in older houses. Using a sewer camera to check the weak areas or clog, our highly trained professionals can quickly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its task-- efficiently carrying wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or municipal system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
