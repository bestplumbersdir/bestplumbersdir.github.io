<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
