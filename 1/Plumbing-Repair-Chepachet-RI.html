That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and disinfected throughout regrowth. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
