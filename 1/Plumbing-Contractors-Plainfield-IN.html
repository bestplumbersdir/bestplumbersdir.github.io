<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
