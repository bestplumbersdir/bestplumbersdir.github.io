Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
