<p>First consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be necessary. Typically, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are below trees, near substantial landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
