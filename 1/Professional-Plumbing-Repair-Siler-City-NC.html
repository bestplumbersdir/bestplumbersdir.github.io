<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
