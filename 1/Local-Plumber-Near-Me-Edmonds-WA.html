<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to 5 days, depending on the size of the house, the number of levels it has actually and the picked pipe material. Throughout a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, reinstall the removed drywall and spot it to eliminate any signs of damage or alteration to your home.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>We specialize in repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electric water heaters and tankless water heaters. Carefully flex the float arm to put additional pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that doesn't have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the outcome of a corroded overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the experts at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and lower wasted water.</p>
