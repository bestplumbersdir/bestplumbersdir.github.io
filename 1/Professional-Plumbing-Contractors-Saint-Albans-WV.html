<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
