<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a very short amount of time due to closing on a house sale.

Friendly, communicated well, totally responsive and really cared to help me through this very stressful task.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
