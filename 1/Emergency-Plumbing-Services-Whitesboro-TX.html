(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
