<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Biddeford ME</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Since of the fundamental style of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or static circulation condition may cause problem dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
