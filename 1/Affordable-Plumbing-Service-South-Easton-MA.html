I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>These branching distribution pipelines form loops and networks including water pipe and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in size. The pipelines provide water for whole neighborhoods along with big commercial, commercial and residential complexes. Depending on the circulation capacity, place and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
