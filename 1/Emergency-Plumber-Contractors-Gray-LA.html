It can take a DIYer a lot of time to locate and total simple repairs, so think about that with the cost when trying to manage the problem on your own. The factor a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can likewise be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can identify the problem and repair it.</p>
