Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage.
