Tru-Soft ® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. The solar crystals are harvested, kiln dried and compressed into 50 Pound. blocks.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
