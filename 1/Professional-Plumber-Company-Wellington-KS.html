<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
