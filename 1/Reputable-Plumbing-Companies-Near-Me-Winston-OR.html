<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you need to first acquire the needed license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our License page for more details on acquiring a license.

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home.

This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
