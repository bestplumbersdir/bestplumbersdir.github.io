<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Willow Spring NC</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
