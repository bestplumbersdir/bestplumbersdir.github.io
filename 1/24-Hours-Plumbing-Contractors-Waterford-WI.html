In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as compounded if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>Gas is difficult to discover, as it's a colorless, odor-free compound. We utilize gas in our houses with gas heaters, stoves, and ovens. American houses access gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a natural gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor appliances can occur rapidly and unexpectedly.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger defense assembly.</p>
