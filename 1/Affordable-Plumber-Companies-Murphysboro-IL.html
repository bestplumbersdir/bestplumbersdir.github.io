<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, benefit, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her house.

Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to prevent the reversal of the circulation of water.

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
