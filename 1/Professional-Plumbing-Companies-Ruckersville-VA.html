A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to land fills and other disposing locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
