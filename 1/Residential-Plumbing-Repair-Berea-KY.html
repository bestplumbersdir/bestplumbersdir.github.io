A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
