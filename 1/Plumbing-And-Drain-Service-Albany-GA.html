<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Albany GA</h3>
<p>In addition to providing timely, effective water heater repair services, our experienced plumbing technicians at Big Blue Plumbing in Alameda, CA, supply complete water heater installation.

<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally sodium. Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a very small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
