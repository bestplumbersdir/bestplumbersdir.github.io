<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
