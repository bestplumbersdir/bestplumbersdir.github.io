You have permanent water hardness if you don't see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting sensitive and scratchy.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
