<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
