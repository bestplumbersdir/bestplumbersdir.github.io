<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is by hand controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light offers a clear image for the technician to accurately examine conditions and identify the performance of the pipes. The info we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and recommend the very best solution as well. We can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence if the pipe requires to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
