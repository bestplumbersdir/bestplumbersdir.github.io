<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
