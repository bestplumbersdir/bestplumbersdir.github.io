<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can end up being a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers sometimes try two or 3 flappers prior to they discover one that works well.</p>
