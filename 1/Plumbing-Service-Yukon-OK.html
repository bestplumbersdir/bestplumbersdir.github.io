<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
