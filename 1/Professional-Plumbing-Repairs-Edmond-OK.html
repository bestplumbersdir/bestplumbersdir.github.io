<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>This is among the main and first questions that you need to ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your house is a vital part to understand whether you should repipe your home. This is not only due to the fact that your plumbing has aged with time, but also since houses that were developed before a certain period are more likely to include galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimum rates if your house was constructed years before that.</p>
