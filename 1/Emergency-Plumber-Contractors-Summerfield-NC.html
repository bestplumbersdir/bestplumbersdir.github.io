A bad plumber can be your worst problem in regards to issues that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Typically handles are toilet parts that get rusty or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back effectively. It's an easy repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush handle out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Image 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new handle into location, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
