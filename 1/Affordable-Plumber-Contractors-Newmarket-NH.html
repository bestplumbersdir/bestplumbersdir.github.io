<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
