<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
