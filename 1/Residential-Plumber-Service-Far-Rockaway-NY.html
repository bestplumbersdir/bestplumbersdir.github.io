<h3>Kitchen Sink Leaking in Far Rockaway New York</h2>
<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you would like to try the gentlest method maybe attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions first!), if that doesn't do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
