<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
