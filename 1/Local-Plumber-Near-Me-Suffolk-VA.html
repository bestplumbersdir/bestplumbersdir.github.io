Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
