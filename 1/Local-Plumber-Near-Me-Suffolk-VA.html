<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
