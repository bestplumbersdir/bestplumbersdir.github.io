You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
