<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
