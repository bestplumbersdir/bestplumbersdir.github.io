<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
