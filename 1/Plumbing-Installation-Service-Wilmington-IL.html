<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
