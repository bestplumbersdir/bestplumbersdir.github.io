<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
