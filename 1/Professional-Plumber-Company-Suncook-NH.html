Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
