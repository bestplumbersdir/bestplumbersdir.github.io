Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Lacking hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a potential concern with the water heater. It can also mean the hot water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years of ages. With heavy rust buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might mean that there have actually been changes in pressure triggering small leakages.</p>

<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of least expensive pressure.

The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
