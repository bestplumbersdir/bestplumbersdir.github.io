<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or filthy drain problems. These chemicals are easy to utilize and affordable, however they harm your pipes and their results are only short-term.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
