<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make odd gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, leading to the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this could be an indicator that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking quickly. You can examine this by filling a number of five-gallon buckets with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
