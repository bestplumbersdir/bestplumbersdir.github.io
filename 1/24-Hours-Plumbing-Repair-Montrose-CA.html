<p>New shower drains create strong seals that are less most likely to loosen over time. Several alternatives are great for tight spaces and allow for quick installation. We can discover a drain that will look excellent with your existing design if you have a historic home. Step the height of your old hot water heater and buy a new one the same height so you do not have to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
