<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
