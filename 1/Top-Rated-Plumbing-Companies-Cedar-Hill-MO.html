<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>The on-the-job training will mainly include dealing with pipes, components, waste systems, and related devices.
