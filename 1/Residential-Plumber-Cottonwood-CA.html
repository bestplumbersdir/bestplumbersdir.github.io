<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to end up being soaked. You may smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that portion of your yard. The situation is fraught with problems due to the fact that the swampiness will attract unwelcome animals. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
