<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
