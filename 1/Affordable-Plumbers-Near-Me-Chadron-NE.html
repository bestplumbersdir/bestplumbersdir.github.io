<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
