<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
