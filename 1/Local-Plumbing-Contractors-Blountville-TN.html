<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>In many cases, a natural gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and accidentally burst a line, this type of circumstance might take place. A house owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an utility company, it might be covered. The sediment trap parts cost $10 to $14 each and plumbers will be able to install it within an hour.</p>

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
