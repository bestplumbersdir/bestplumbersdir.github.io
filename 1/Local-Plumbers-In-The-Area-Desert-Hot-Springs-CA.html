However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>You may have heard stories about a hot water heater blowing up inside a home or business! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a hazardous time bomb. The age of your water heater.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not.
