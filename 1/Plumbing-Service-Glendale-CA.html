<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
