<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
