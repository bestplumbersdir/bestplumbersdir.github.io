We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a cautious cleaning.</p>
