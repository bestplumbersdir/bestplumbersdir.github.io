<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Glen Cove NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both provide various advantages and benefits such as removing the metallic taste from your water.</p>
