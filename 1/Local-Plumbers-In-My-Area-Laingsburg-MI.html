<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
