<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the makeup water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the potable water supply. The very best way to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
