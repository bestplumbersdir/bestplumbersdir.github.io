<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex clinical procedure, but easy to treat. It utilizes salt to get rid of minerals and smells found in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that connect and bring in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
