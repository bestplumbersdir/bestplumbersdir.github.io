Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through.

While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
