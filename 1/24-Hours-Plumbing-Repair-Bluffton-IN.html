The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
