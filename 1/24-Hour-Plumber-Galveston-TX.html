The reasons for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed issues, a repair or replacement of the components might suffice. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>

So, you'll discover the same problems cropping up once again and again, although you've had them repaired.
