<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
