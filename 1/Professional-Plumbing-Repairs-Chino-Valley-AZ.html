<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification.
