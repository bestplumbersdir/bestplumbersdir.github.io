<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a severe safety concern. Don't take any opportunities. Make certain the softener is set to the hardness of your supply of water.
