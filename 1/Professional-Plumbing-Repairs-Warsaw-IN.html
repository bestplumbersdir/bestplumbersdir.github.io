<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Warsaw IN</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
