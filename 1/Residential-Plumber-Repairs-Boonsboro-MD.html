<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for usage. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration.</p>
