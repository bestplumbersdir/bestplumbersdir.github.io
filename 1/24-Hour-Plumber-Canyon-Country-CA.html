<p>Purchase a borax replacement water softer in the EU and it's tremendously likely you will be buying a box of salt sesquicarbonate - Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2 H2O. Salt sesquicarbonate is a hydrated crystal made up from sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate and is very frequently discovered in bath salts.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
