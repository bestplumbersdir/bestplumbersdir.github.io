<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome.
