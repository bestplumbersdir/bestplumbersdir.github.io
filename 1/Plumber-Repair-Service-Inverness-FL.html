<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Inverness FL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly unusual cases where the building is deemed to not present a danger to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
