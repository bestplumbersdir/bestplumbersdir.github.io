For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to proceed and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
