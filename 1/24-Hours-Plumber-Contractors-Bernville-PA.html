<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular technique of clearing blockages. They normally utilize sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky build-up. While reliable at eliminating obstructions, they might do your plumbing more damage than excellent. Here are 3 factors to avoid putting these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
