<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those problems. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>

The plumbing in the house need to work well or backup can happen, and septic tanks might need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
