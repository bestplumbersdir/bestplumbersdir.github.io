<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
