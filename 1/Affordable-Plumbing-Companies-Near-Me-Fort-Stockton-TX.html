<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building permit is typically required prior to a plumbing permit can be provided. Soften just what you need to. People often select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be linked to a softener. Oftentimes, people select to soften only the hot water.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently similar, though replacement usually will not need surcharges, such as application charges. New meters should satisfy policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may require a distinct meter for their services, restricting your options.
