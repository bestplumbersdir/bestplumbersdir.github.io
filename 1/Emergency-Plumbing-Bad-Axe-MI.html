It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
