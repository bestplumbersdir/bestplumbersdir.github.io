<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
