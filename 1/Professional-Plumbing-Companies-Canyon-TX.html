<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
