<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
