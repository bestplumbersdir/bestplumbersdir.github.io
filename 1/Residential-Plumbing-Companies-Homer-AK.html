It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be provided.</p>
