You, for that reason, need to utilize more and more detergent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
