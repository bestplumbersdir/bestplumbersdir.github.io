<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or temporary connection in between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
