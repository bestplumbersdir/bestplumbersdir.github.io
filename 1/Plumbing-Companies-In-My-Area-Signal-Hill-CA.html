Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
