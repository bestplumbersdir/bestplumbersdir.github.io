The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention gadgets. For house, it is important for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates the use of each new renter. The correction should be made before water service is allowed if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
