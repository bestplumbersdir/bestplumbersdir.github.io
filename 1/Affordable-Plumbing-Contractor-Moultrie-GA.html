<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
