<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
