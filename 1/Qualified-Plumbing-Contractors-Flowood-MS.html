<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded clogs further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be cleaned of contaminants and will need to be changed. (This should not hold true if the resin is regularly regrowed and preserved.) Consult your water softener dealer for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Your company will call when the installer is on the way, generally about an hour prior to the arranged appointment time. Upon arrival, a trusted professional will provide their House Depot Service Provider badge, and perform the initial walkthrough to verify the scope of work. When you agree to progress, the installation can start. This usually just takes a couple of hours, but if there are unexpected circumstances, your service provider might need to return the following day.</p>
