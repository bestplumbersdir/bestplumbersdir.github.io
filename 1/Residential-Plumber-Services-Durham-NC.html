<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling.

Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
