<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Commerce GA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
