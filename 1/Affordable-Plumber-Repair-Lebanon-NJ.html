If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
