    <meta name="description" content="24 Hour Plumbing Service Harbor City California - Trying to extend the pipe while you're working overhead in a tight space is both time-consuming and physically challenging, so it's often quicker (and simpler) just to cut out the entire drain trap and replace it. To install another weld-type drain, such as this 2-Inch Sioux Chief PVC Drain (available at SupplyHouse ), you'll want to assemble and dry fit all the connections before you glue them together.">

It is very important that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
