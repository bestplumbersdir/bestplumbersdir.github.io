<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn out sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing team does the job rapidly and economically.</p>
