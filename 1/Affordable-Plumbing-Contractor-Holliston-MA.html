<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
