You, for that reason, have to utilize increasingly more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
