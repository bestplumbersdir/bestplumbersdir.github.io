Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>

<p>On and off does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is generally spotted before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continually leak out really slowly. Over time it can lead to a substantial build of water. Leaked water typically stays under your home and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially cause a cavity if your home's foundation was not properly compressed.

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
