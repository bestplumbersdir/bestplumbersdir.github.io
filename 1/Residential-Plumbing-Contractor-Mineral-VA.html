<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must fulfill or surpass the state standards and bring the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
