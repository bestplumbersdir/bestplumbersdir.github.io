<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
