<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.

Much more contemporary pipes will not last forever, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that might be reaching completion of their lifespan.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
