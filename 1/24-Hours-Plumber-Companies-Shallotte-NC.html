I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
