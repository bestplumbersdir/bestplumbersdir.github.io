<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
