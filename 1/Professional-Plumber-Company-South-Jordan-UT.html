When chemicals are added to a fire protection system supplied by a potable water supply, increased defense is also needed. If you have children, remind them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
