<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that danger, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
