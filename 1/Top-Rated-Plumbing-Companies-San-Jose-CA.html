The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected.
