<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly.

You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
