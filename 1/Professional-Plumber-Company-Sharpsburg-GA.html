<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
