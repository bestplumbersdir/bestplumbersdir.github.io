<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and breakable to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as an outcome of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
