<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham.

Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
