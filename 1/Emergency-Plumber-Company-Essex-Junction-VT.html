<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is cheap and simple. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
