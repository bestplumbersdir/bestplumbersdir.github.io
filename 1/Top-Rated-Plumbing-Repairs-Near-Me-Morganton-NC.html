<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to consider.

When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
