<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the most significant sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. You may have sediment that has actually developed up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower.
