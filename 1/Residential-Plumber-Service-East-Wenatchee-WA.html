<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service East Wenatchee WA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>

<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating offers a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can result in a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause significant problems and damage-- specifically common in older homes. Using a sewer camera to examine the weak areas or clog, our extremely trained experts can rapidly locate the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- effectively transporting wastewater to your septic system or community system.</p>
<p>Before our professional specialists can start using their abilities and experience, we initially need to make sure that the line is correctly cleaned and prepared for our repair. Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a cautious cleaning.</p>
