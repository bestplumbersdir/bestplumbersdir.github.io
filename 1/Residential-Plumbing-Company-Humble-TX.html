<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water system. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
