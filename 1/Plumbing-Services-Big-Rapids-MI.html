<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Big Rapids MI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally rare cases where the building is considered to not position a threat to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
