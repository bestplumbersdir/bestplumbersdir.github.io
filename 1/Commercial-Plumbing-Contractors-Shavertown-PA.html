<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
