<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Plymouth NC</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction. In this post we take a look at plumbers vs. plumbing contractors and specialty plumbers. RPZ backflow systems, on the other hand, have valves that just open when water is flowing forward.</p>
