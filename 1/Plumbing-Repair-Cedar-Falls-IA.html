<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly.
