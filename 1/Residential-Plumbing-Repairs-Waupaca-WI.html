<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
