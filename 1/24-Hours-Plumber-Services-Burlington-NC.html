<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Burlington NC</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
