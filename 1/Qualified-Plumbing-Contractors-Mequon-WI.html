<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
