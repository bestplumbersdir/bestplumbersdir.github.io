<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Berkeley Heights NJ 07922</h3>
<p>Water temperature concerns can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas.
