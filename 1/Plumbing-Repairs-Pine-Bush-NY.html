Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

This repair approach is typically utilized to replace the old pipe with a similar or bigger pipe.</p>
