<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you should first get the needed authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our License page for more information on acquiring an authorization. As soon as you obtain a license you can begin with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help ease those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils which too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>
<p>Some property owners may think of water softeners as a high-end item, something that's good to have" but not entirely required. Nevertheless, difficult water can cause whatever from minor annoyances, like spots on dishes or soap residue, to major problems like a shorter lifespan for your water heater, dishwasher, and other important house devices. For these factors and others, a water softener can be an useful investment for your house.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve.

All gas piping setups need an authorization and inspection.</p>
