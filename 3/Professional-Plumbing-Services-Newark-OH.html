<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another product. Changing galvanized pipes in older homes is important because of the method galvanized pipes tend to break down throughout the years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system.

<p>A continuously running toilet indicates your home is squandering water and you're paying higher utility expenses than necessary.

<p>I think I got duped. I called thinking it could possibly be fixed, but they stated it would need to be replaced. This was the cost for the new disposal and installation, even with my teacher's discount. Call Premier Plumbing in Chesapeake Virginia when you need water heater repair or installation.

<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, any person who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership must possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a license and inspection.</p>
