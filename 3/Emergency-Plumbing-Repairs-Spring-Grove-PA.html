<p>Before the repair technician begins the repair process, he must make certain he has actually assessed the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. Appropriate safety preventative measures should be followed for correct entry if the area is considered a confined area. A safe and correct work environment may require the positioning of safety barricades or entry constraints around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your workspace are not hurt. This could impact the professional's capability to effectively finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
