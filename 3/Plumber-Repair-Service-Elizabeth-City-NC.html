But while little drips ought to not be cause for concern, house owners must keep an eye on the water heater leakages. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was professional and friendly. He also finished the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less costly than I prepared for. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
