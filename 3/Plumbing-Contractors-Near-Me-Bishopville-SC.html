Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground zero for obstructions. As hair combines with soap, it can develop the ideal storm for plumbing blockages. With time, these blockages can worsen and avoid your bathtub from draining at all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.

Please ensure to take the appropriate preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>
