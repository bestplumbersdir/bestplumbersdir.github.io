<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
