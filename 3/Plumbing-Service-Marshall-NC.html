Assemblies not currently noted should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is accountable for protecting the water supply by making sure, through plan review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
