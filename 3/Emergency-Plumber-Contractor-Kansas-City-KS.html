<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "hard" depends on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in fact, vital everyday nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating flavor many individuals find desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water pipe are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed before the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and decomposed for many years. Older pipes can cause major leakages and even infect your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
