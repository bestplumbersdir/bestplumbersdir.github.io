<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and circulation pipes are frequently discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements generally found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also very durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
