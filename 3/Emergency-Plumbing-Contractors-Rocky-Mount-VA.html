If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping.

There are numerous kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>

And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
