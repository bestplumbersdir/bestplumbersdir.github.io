<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of utility companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor comes from.
