<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or stained water, it generally represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
