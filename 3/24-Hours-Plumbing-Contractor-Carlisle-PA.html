<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
