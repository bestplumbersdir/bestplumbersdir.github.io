<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
