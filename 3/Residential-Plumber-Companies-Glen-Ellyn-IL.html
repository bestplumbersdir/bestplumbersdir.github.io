The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
