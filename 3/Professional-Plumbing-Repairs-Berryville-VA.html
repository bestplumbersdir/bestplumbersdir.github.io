However you risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and circumstances that require backflow prevention devices. For home, it is important for owners to inform the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District examines the use of each brand-new occupant. The correction must be made before water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the renter owner.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The standard methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.
