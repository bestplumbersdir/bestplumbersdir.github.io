<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or go beyond the state requirements and carry the duty for imposing them.</p>
<p>It generally represents rust and mineral buildup if you notice low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
