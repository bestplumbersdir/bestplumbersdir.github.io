<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

Instead, our professionals use a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart.

This repair approach is generally used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>
