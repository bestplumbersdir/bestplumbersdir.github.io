<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Lake Park GA</h3>

Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
