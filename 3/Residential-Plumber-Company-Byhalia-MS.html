<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
