<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
