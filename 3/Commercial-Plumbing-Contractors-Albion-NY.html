If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
