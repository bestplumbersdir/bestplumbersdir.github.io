Everyday appliances, such as a stove or water heater, can be badly fitted or can age with time, triggering deterioration that leads to gas leak.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
