Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
