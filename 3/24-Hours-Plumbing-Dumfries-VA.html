<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
