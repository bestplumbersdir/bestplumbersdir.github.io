<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
