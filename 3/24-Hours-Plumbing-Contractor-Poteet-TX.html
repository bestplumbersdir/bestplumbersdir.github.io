<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these elements not only dry your skin and hair but also develop in pipes and home appliances reducing their efficiency and life span. Your washing water, dishwasher and machine heater are all negatively affected by difficult water. The effects of hard water can be seen on your meals, the color and softness of your clothes, the movie on your shower door and even your individual look and comfort.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
