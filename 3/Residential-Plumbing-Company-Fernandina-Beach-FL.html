<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
