<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection provides inspection services for all commercial and commercial structures, and validates compliance with the electrical code.

Licensed professional plumbers will find and repair the gas leak, offer licenses, and collaborate with the city for final inspections.
