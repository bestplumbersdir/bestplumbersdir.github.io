<p>First turn off the power to the hot water heater at your main electrical panel. Then follow the exact same draining pipes treatments as for a gas water heater.

That method, you will not be fixing the exact same disposal 2 weeks later on.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
