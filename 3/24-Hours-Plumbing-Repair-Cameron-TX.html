<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
