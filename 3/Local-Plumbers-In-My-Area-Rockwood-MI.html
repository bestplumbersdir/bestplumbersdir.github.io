<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Relatively new technology has produced tankless water heaters. Instead of, holding a set amount of hot water, it heats it on an on-demand basis.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous.
