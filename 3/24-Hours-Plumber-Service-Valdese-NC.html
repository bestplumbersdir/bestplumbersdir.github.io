Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed.
