<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
