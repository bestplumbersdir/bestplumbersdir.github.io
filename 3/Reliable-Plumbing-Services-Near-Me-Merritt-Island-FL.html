<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas a smell frequently connected with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this unique scent allows you to smell a potential leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>It's an excellent concept to set up annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you understand that you have a history of leaking or obstructing. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List to test the backflow assembly. The tester will send the results to us. Be sure to find a plumber you trust who will get the task done right at a sensible cost if you need a garbage disposal replacement.</p>
