For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
