To avoid this disaster, ensure to utilize your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never to use them to heat your home. The very same opts for portable gas ranges, which are to be utilized outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make sure someone is awake to monitor them. Many households die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide gas poisoning over night. Another safety measure to take is to never ever run your generators in enclosed spaces.
