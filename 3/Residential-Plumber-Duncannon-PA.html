Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
