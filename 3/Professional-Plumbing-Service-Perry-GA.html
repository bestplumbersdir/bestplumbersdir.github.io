<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. When looking for a new flapper, your best option is to try and discover the exact same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve.

If you don't know your model number, however, we do offer an extensive selection of "will fit" flappers to assist you out.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by aligning it. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>5. Put hot water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never ever an enjoyable experience. Luckily, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>
