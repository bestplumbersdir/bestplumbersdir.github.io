Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>

While it may look like a task worth taking on, there are a number of reasons to prevent taking a DIY approach to a sewer line repair job and instead choose to employ a licensed, professional plumber.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
