<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
