He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
