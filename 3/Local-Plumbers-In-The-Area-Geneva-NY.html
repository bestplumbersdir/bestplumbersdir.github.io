<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Geneva NY 14456</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to blockages that come from inside the home.

When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will figure out the level of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
