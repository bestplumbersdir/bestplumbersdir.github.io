<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
