<p>One typical method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread out greatly if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the public water supply.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
