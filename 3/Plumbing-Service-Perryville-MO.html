<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
