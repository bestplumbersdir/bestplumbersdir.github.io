<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
