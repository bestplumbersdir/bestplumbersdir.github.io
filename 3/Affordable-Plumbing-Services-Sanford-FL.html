Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a great concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and might ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
