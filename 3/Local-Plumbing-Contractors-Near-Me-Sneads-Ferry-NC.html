If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
