<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
