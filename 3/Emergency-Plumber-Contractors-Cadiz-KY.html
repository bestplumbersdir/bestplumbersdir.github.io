<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
