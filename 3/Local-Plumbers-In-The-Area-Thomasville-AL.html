<p>No other room in a home contains as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Prevention is better than treatment. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water supply. Discolored water- Your water ought to always be clear. Discolored water signifies rust in your pipes or water heater. If your water is an unusual color, this warrants professional attention.
