<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is required to guarantee it was repaired appropriately.
