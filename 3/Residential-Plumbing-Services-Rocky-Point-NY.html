<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
