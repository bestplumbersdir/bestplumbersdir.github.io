<p>You live in an older home. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
