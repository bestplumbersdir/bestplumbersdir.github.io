These crystals are microscopic and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
