<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to think of. Energy Efficiency. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is recommended. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF).

<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there ought to be no problem in getting most of the waste through.

Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
