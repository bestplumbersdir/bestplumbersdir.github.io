<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
