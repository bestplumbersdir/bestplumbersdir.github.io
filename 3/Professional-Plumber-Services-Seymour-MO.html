Repiping is a process of installing a brand-new water line plumbing system. This procedure generally includes removing old readily available pipes and then installing the new plumbing system. Standard repiping tasks consist of installation of all brand-new hot and cold domestic water piping from the water source to all existing components and faucets. Unless particularly included in the proposal, drain replacement and fixtures are not included.</p>
