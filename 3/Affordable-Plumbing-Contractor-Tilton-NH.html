If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they cake to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to repair the issue and find for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
