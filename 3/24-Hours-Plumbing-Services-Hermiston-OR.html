<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular contaminants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can assist ease those problems. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
