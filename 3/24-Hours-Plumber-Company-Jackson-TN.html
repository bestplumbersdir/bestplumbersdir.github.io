<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Many folks replace their hot water heater due to poor efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive step. If your hot water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about replacing it with a more effective design. Water on the floor can suggest used parts.

<p>A. Using phosphoric acid normally will help remove them if you have rust areas. , if you would like to try the gentlest approach maybe try using some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't work then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety cautions initially!).

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

Increased defense is also needed when chemicals are added to a fire defense system supplied by a potable supply of water. If you have children, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
