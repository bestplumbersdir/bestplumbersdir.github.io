<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection offers inspection services for all commercial and commercial buildings, and confirms compliance with the electrical code. The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the suitable electrical code in order to decrease individual, and structural electrical hazards. If you suspect a gas leak, initially call your local energy company then call a plumber. Licensed professional plumbers will repair the gas and detect leak, supply licenses, and coordinate with the city for final inspections. An utility company will spot if there is a gas leak, but they do not locate the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
