<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
