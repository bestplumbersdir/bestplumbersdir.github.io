If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
