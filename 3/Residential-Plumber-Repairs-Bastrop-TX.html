<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct website inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a real or prospective  cross-connection hazard on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are just carried out on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Using one or a combination of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection straight without uprooting anymore than we need to.</p>
