<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
