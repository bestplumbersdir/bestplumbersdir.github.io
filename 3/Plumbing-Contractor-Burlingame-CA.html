<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you must probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells.
