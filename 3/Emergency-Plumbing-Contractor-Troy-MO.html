<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
