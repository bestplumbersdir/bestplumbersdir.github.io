<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or dirty drain issues. These chemicals are easy to utilize and low-cost, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will likewise gnaw at the pipe developing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
