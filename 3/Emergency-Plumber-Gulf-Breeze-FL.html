<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
