Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
