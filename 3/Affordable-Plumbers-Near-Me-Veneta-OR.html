Toilets conserve lives. It might sound insane, however it's true. Appropriate sanitation in the form of operating toilets and well-maintained sewer system helps prevent possibly lethal diseases from assaulting you and your household. In the United States we are incredibly fortunate that most of us never need to worry about catching such health problems, however it is still important to keep our toilets clean and in good operating condition to avoid the potential for illness to our families - in addition to conserving ourselves the basic inconvenience and high cost of toilet problems left ignored for too long. Thankfully, most toilet problems are relatively easy to fix yourself, and your buddies at ® are here to assist arm you with the details and tools you need to handle almost any toilet crisis rapidly and easily.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification.
