<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. There are two standard piping products utilized by plumbing specialists.
