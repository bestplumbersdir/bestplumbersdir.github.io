<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
