Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals feature this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't break as quick.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a gas line may be covered if it is burst. This type of situation might happen if a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line. A homeowner's policy might cover this type of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an utility company, it may be covered.
