<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning effectively. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
