The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
