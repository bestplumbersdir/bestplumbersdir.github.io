Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a gas line might be covered if it is burst. This kind of situation might occur if a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and accidentally burst a line. A property owner's policy may cover this type of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an energy company, it may be covered.
