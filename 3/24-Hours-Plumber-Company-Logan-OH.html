Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were wonderful at fixing the clogged drain, but extremely extremely sloppy about fixing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
