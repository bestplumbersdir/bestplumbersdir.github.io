<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician switched off the water supply and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

The consumer helped our technician in moving the toilet back into its correct area, and the professional tightened up the bolts prior to bring back the water system and guaranteeing that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation.
