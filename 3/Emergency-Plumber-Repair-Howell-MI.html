<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items containing harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Have non-testable" backflow gadgets replaced at the periods described above. Have testable" backflow assemblies evaluated yearly and rebuilt or changed as needed (normally every 5-8 years).
