<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
