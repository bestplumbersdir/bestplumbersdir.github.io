A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement developed to prevent the turnaround of the flow of water once it has actually travelled through the valve. The 2 kinds of pipes that we choose to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two extremely various products, but they both have amazing durability and longevity.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
