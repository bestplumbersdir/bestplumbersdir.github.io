<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
