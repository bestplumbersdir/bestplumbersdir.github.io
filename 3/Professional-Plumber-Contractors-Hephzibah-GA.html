<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Master plumber: To become a master plumber, a person must have a particular number of years' experience as a journeyman plumber, in addition to an associate's degree or training at an employment school. A master plumber need to pass an examination that generally encompasses both composed and practical knowledge. They should also finish continuing education hours every year. Usually the business owner, a master plumber goes through inspection and needs to make sure all journeyman plumbers working for his or her company remain in compliance with plumbing policies.</p>
