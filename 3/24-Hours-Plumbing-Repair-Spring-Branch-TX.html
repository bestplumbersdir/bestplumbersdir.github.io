<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.
