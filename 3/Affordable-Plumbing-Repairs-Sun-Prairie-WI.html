<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>
