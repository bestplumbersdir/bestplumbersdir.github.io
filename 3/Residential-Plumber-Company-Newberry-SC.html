<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system.

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
