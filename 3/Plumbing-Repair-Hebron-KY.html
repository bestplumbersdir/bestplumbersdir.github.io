<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
