<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right now. Before you can request an inspection, you must initially get the required license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for additional information on getting a permit. As soon as you get a permit you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you need to require inspection prior to you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
