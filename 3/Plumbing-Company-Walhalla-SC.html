It is very difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well sufficient explained to allow others to assess them and to confirm the results. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
