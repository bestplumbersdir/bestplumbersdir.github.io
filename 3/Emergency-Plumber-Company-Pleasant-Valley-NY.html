The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
