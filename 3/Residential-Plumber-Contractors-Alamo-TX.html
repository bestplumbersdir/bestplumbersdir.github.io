Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and offered for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration, request that a new one be set up.</p>
