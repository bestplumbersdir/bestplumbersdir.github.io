Which is why choosing a comfy, well-made toilet seat is very important. However, you have to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
