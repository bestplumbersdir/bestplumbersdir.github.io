<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines. Generally, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run because it might resolve the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's smart to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
