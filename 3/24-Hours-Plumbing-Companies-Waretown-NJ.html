<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with hard water, you might not recognize just how much it impacts you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
