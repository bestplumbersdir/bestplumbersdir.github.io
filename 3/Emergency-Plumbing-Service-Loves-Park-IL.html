<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<h3>Leak Repair in Loves Park Illinois</h2>
