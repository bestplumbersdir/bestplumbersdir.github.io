The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove short-term solidity in water.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this technique utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline form that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow usually through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regrowth.</p>
