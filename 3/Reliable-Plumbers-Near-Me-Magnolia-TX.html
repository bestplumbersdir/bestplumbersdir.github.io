<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
