<p>If you've always lived in an area with difficult water, you might not realize how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Tough water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp.

If your house was developed before the 1970s, we highly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. Opportunities are that your house may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at ideal rates if your house was developed decades prior to that.</p>
