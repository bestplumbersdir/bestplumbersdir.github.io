Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property.
