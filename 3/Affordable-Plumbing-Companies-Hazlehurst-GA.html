<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more fragile and susceptible to cracking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and pressures as an outcome of temperature change and ice development. And these differences determine the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
