<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face circumstances, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Sometimes, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not securely run and go into the basement up until the sewage is extracted and the basement is generally cleaned up.
