<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are certain pollutants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those problems. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>

The new pipes that are utilized are normally made from copper since of their sturdiness and other elements. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
