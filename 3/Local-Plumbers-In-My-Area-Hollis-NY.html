<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation.

Cleanouts allow simple access into your drain system so when you have a problem a service technician can get the rooter machine into the line to clear the clog or camera the line.</p>

Although the lifespan of your home's pipes differs due to a wide range of aspects (including wear and tear and whether you reside in a cold-weather environment), an excellent general rule is to replace them if they are 50-years-old or older.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to make use of a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and recognize problem.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
