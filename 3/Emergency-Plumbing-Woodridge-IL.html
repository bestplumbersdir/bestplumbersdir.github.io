<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing obstructions. They generally utilize sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While reliable at removing obstructions, they could do your plumbing more harm than great. Here are three reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Learning: Soft water is an ease to live with, difficult water is not. Leader Plumbing is prepared to deal with all your commercial and residential plumbing jobs and the unanticipated plumbing emergency.

Bill Howe recommends replacing old water shut off valves under sinks and behind toilets every 5-7 years. Burst water shutoffs are among the leading reasons for home flooding.</p>
