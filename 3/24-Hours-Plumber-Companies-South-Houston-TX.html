<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes.

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
