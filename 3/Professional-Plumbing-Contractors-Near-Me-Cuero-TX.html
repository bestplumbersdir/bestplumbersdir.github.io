Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe location.

If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
