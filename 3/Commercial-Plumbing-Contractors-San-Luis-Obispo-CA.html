<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working effectively since hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
