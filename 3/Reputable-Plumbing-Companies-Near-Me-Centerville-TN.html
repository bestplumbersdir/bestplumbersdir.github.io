It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
