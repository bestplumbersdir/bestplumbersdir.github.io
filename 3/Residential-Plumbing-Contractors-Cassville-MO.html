<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
