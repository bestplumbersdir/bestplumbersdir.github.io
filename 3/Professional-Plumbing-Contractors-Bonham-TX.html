<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with difficult water, you might not realize just how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Tough water interferes with the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
<p>In fact, that's how tough water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves behind. Gradually these deposits can accumulate, clog, and even rust pipes and cause significant plumbing problems.
