<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services South Windsor CT</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to schedule annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of blocking or leaking. Test.
