<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the suitable safety measures if using among these products.</p>
