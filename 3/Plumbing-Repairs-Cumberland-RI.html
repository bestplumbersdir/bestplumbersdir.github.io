Scientists discovered that softened water utilizes nearly 30% less detergent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings increases to almost 70%.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
