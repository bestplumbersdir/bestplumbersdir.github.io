<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if utilizing among these products.</p>
