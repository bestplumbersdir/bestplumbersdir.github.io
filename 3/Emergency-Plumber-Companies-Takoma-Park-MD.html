A toilet's tank is made up of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
