<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might have the ability to fully or partly remove copper, radium, iron, and manganese, in addition to calcium and magnesium. If passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing, note that copper can reenter the water after. These softeners may have unique filter media and may cost more than common softeners. Before using a softener for this purpose, follow the recommendations listed in the house Water Treatment.</p>
