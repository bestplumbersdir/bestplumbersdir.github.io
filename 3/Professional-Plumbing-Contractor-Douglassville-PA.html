Blanc also constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might likewise thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
