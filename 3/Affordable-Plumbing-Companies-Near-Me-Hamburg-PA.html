<p>Hydro jetting works by blasting highly pressurized water through your sewer line, and it is substantially more effective and affordable than alternative techniques of lowering obstruction in sewer lines. It's so efficient in truth, that Northwest Drain Station uses a no dig-up warranty.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>

This is cash and a natural resource diminishing the drain. Water preservation in the desert is very important and older toilets can utilize 3.5 gallons of water per flush!

Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
