In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks. Should you come across a specialty faucet repair that requires special order parts, we can position the order and get the sink fixed as quickly as the part shows up. Ion exchange resins, in the type of beads, are a functional component of domestic water softening systems.
