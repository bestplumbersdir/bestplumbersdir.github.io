<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Often triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl.

Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
