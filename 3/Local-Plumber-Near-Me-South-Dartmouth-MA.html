<p>If you believe your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they lead to small leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
