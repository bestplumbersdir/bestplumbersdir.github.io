The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
