As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
