<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
