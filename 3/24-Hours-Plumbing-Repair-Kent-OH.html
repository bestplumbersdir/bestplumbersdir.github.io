Our bacteriostatic water softener systems also use the advanced technology of the iGen ® ... the valve so clever it does the thinking for you. The iGen ® monitors your water to enhance water quality and running performance, suggesting you don't need to be a water professional to guarantee that your system never wastes a drop.</p>
