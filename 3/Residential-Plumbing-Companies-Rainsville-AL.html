I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
