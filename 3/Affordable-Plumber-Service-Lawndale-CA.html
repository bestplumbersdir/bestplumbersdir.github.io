These products, after all, make the process appear quite easy. Regrettably it's not as simple as you might think, and those items are not necessarily going to fix the issue. In many cases it's more beneficial to work with a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.

TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially useful in finding an issue.</p>
