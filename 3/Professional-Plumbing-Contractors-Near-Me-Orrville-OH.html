<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
