<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Nottingham MD</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To prevent deterioration from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in destructive products. By having the anode rod examined routinely and changed as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
