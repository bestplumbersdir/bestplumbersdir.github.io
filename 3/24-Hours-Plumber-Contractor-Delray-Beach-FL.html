<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to become soggy. You may smell the horrible smell of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that part of your lawn. Because the swampiness will draw in unwelcome animals, the scenario is fraught with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>Often caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl.
