<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
