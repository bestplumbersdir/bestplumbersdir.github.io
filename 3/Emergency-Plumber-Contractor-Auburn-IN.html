<p>No, you ought to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are included into gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking.
