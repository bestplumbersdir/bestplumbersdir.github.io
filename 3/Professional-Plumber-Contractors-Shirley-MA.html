<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
