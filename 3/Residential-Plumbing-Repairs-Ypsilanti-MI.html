<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>By itself, natural gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of energy companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg smell originates from.
