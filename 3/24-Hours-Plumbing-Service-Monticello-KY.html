<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have permanent water hardness if you do not see limescale accumulation but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting scratchy and delicate. If you smell gas, do not attempt to locate the leak. Rather, leave the house or building right away. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might create a trigger. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
