Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
