<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
