Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
