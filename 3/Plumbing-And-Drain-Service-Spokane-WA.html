<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Spokane WA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is considered to not present a risk to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
