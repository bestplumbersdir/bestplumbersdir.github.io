<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system providing the makeup water, backpressure is created. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then enter the potable water system. The very best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
