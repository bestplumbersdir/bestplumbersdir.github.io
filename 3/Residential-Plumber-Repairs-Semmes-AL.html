<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
