<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
