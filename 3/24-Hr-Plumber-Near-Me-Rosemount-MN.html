<p>Prior to the repair service technician begins the repair procedure, he must make sure he has evaluated the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any limiting conditions. If the area is thought about a confined space, correct safety precautions should be followed for correct entry. A appropriate and safe  workplace might involve the positioning of safety barricades or entry restrictions around the workspace so the repair specialist or the general public around your workspace are not harmed.
