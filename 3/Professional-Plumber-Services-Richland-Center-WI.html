<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands unclean with. It requires more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is frequently due to how troublesome it is to examine the damage. This is much more problematic if the damage is irreparable or needs more substantial repair, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
