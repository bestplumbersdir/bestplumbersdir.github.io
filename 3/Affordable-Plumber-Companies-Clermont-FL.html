So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
