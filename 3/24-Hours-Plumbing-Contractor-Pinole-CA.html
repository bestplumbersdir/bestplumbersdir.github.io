<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
