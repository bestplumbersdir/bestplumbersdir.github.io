<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Each and every single person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work crew. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to help me through this very demanding job. All of the people I came across were role models for what a well run service company should be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're great.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger regular circulation to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
