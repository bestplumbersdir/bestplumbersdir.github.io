Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
