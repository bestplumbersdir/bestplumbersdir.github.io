If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
