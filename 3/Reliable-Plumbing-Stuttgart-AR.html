<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
<p>The drain valve (Photo 2) on old water heaters often blocks. Be client if the water drains slowly. CAUTION: It's scalding hot!
