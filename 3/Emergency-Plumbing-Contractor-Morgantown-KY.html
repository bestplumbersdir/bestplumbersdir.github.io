<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Morgantown KY</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, having a waste disposal unit in fact protects your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food washed down a drain unintentionally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering blockages and gradually damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash directly down easily.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
