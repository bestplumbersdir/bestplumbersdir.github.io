<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible issue with the water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also imply the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy corrosion accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might mean that there have actually been variations in pressure triggering little leaks.</p>
