<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to purchase a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual flow, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure might require changing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
