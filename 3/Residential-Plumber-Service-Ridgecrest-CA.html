<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium.

The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>These problems can be looked after except for fractures in the body or interior lining of the disposal. You will need to install a brand-new garbage disposal if this is your issue. You need to repipe your house right away if your home has lead pipes. These pipes could be harmful to your health by enabling lead to permeate into your water supply.
