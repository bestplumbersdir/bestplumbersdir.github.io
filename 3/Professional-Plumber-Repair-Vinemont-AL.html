<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
