Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
