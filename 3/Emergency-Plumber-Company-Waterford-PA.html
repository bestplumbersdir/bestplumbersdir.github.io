<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>Garbage disposal units may cost more when they have to fit local water and sewer capacities. The plumbing in your house must work well or backup can happen, and septic systems might need to be upgraded to work with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
