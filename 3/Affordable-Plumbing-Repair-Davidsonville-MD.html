<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Installed under the kitchen sink, a garbage disposal uses sharp blades and a motor to grind (and virtually melt) food waste so it can flow down through the drains and into the sewage system.
