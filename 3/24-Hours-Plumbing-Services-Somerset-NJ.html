Some house owners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.

<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty inexpensive and easy to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually causing a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
