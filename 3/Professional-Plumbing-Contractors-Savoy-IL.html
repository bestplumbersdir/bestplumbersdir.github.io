As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.

<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Savoy IL</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>The drain valve (Picture 2) on old water heaters frequently clogs up. If the water drains gradually, be patient. CAUTION: It's scalding hot!
