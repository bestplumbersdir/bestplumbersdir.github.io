When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.

<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more costly to repipe because the plumber will have to navigate through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge job - and it's a task you wish to get right. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it complicated.
