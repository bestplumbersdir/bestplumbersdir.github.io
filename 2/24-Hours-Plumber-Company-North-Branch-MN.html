<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your brand-new disposal.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
