Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

When you attach the P-trap, also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
