<p>It is not constantly due to blockages that originate inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
