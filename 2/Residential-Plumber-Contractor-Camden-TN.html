<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
