<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility consists of some amounts of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional costs.
