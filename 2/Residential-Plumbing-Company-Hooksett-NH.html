<p>In truth, that's how tough water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves behind.

<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
