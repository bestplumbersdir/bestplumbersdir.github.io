<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Drain Clearing in Mount Vernon Ohio</h2>
<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
