<p>If you believe your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
