<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
