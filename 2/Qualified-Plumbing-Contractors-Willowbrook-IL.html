Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly cause a clog.

Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
