It depends upon perspective, and what you as an individual feel are the benefits you and your household need many.</p>
<p>You might be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save money.

Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
