<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
