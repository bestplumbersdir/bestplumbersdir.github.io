<h3>Blocked Sewer in Auburn CA 95603 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to attain their objective, however fire department vehicles often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
