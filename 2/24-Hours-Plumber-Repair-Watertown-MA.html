<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
