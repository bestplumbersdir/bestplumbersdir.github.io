<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
