At Green Hills Plumbing we are your garbage disposal service company. When your system stops working, we'll be there to help you get it back up and running.

Damaged Stems & Sprayers - Faucet handle stems could be worn away with mineral deposits, and caulk around the base of the faucet might be missing out on or permit water to leak from manage locations. Pipes, gaskets, and sprayer wands and parts do wear with duplicated us.</p>
<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to see what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger clogs and jams - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
