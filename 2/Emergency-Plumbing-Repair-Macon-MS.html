<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an essential part in an advanced system that has been developed and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run off from rainstorms and channel it safely into the cities drainage systems.
