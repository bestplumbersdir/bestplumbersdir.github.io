First, plans for each device to be set up must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Turned down strategies should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner.
