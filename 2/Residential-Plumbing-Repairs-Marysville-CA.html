<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
