<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair.

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
