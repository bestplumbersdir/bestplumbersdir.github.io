<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Ahoskie NC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not present a risk to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
