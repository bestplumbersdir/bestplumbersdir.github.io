<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
