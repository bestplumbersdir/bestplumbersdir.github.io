<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
