They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
