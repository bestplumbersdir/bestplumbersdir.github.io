<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Service in Andrews</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save cash. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and prevent larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
