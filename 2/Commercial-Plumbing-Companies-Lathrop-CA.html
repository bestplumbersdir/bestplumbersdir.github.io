<p>Each component of the assembly should be checked to identify what requires repair. The field test may not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair set are essential. There might be additional test treatments, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can supply information revealing the intensity of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
