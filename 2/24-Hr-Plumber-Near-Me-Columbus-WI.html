Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
