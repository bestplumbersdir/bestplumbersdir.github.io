There are a couple of food products you must most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
