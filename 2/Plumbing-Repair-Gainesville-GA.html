<p>The more often a garbage disposal is utilized (correctly), the better it will grind food waste and withstand rusting. You can keep odors away by grinding up lemon or orange peels inside it. Harder materials, like eggshells and fish bones, scour the disposal walls and help keep them clean too. It's a great concept to find a plumber that uses a comprehensive variety of plumbing services.

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
