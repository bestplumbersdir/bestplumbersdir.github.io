<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
