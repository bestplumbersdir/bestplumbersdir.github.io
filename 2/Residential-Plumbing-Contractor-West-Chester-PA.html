<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair in West Chester Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
