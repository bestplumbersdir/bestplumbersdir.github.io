If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
