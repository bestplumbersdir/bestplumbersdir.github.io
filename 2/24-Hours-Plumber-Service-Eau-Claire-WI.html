<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Eau Claire WI</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in second houses gets rid of risks of water damage. Traditional warm water tanks have danger of leaking, which can lead to pricey damage repairs, especially when left ignored. A tankless hot water heater has no risk of leaking a complete tank of water and causing damage. Plumbing and heating problems need to be dealt with by qualified and competent professionals, like those on our team.
