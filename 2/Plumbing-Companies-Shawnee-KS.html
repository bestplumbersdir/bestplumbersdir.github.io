<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Shawnee KS</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other disposing areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
