<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and might expose employees during the sewer repair process. If your Do It Yourself dig strikes a natural gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a threat of fire or surge damage to your residential or commercial property or your neighbor's. Another danger in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your security and health are too essential to risk in a DIY sewer project! Avoid these security dangers by employing a professional plumber.</p>
