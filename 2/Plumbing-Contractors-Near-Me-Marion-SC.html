<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer accreditation courses created to train experts to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
