<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening.

Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
