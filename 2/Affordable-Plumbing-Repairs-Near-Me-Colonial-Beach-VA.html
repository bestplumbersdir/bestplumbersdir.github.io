<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and might sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink film is actually a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other 2 kinds of salts. Once the new salt has had an opportunity to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>It's difficult to figure out if you have actually cracked or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out. Cracked or broken drains are normally preceded by recurring blockages, constant foul drain smells or the presence of sewer flies.
