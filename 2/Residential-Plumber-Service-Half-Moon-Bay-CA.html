The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.
