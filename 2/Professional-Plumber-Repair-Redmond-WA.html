<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can develop a suction result and draw potential pollutants into the potable (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are typically discovered in many homes. Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water till it's needed.
