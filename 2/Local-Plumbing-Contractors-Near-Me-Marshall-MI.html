<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
