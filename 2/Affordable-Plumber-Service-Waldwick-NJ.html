<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Waldwick NJ</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you, then you've got a problem with over-running or leaking. This water is being disposed down the overflow tube squandering approximately 200 gallons of water each day. That takes a toll on your water costs, not to point out the threat of a more major leak that could damage your home with flooding.</p>
