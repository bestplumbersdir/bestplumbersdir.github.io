<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
