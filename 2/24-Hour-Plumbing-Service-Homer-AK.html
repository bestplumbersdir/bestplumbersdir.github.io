<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Homer AK</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
