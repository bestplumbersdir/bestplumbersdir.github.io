<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Prevention is better than remedy. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water supply. Discolored water- Your water needs to constantly be crystal clear. Discolored water is a sign of rust in your pipes or hot water heater. This warrants professional attention if your water is an uncommon color. New gas line setups are done for new appliances like burners, stoves, outdoor lighting, and grills. Materials consist of pipes, fasteners and valves. The size of the pipes need to be proportional to the size of the home appliance being set up.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham.

When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes great.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
