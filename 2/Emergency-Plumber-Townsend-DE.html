<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
