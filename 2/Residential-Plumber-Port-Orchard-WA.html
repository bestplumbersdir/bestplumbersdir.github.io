It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be offered.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
