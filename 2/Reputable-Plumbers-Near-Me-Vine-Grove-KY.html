It is necessary that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
