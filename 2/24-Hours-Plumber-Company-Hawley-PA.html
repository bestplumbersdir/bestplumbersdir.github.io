<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Hard water can leave your hair looking dry and dull and your skin feeling itchy and flakey, and that's just what it does to your body. In your house, hard water mineral accumulation on faucets and showerheads triggers them to lose efficiency and function, and etching and identifying on your glasses makes it look like you never ever even ran the dishwasher.</p>
