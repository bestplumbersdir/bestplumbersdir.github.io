<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
