Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
