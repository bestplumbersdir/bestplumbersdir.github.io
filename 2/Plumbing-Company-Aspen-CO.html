<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
