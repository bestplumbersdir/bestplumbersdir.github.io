<p>Long-term magnetic water conditioning devices have actually been marketed based upon a range of claims concerning their impact on water firmness and related scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not been able to figure out standards for these products and report inconsistent efficiency to date.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
