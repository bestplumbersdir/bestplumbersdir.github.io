<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to attain their objective, but fire department automobiles frequently carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
