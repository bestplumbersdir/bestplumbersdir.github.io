Blanc likewise constructed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
