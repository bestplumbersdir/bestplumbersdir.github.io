<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This deterioration can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
