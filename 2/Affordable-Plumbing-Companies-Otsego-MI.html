<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
