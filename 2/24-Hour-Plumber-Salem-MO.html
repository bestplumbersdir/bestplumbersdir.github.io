If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is relatively brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
