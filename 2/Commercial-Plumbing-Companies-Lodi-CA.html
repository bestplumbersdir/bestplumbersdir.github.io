<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification.

<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
