Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
