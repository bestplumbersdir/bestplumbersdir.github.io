<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
