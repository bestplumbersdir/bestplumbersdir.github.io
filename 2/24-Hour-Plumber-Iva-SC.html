<h3>Water Heater Repair Services in Iva SC 29655</h3>
<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can range from leakages, defective or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned concerns, a repair or replacement of the components might be adequate. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems happening regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
