<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working successfully since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use a growing number of detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
