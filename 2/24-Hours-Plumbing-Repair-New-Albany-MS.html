<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed during construction of a new or refurbished structure is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
