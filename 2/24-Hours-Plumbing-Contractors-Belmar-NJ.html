<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Belmar NJ</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
