<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. You may need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is relatively brand-new.

When the water is very hard and it is used greatly, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
