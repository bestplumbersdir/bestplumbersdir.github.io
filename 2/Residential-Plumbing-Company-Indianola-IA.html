Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt.

It is important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
