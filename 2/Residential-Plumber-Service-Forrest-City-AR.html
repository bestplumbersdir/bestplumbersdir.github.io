<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with tough water, you may not realize how much it affects you-- but if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Hard water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
