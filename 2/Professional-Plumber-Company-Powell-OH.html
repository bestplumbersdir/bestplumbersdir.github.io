<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Every water heater we install has actually been checked under the most severe water temperature levels and was constructed to last a very long time.

Efficiency and sturdiness are crucial parts of every hot water heater we offer. That's why citizens of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have been using Service Specializeds for water heater setups for nearly 40 years now. Our local plumbing contractors more than happy to work with you to come up with the ideal hot water heater system for your home or business.</p>
