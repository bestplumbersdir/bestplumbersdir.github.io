<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Little Falls MN</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
