Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
