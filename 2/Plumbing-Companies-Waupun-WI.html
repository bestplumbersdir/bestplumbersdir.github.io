<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
