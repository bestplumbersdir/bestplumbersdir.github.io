<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
