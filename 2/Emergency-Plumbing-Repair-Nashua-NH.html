<p>When looking for a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to use trained and certified specialists for all aspects of your plumbing and gas line installation. When your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll desire an audit of the plumbing and installation to make sure that there are no gas leakages. This must be done prior to the plumber leaves the task. The audit will decrease the chances of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves immediately if you do notice a pungent odor in your home after your plumber leaves.
