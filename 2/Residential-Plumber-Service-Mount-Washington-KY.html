<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
