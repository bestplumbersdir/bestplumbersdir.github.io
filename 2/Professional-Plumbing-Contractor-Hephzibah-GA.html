<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Hephzibah GA 30815</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
