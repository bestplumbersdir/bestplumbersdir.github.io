<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.
