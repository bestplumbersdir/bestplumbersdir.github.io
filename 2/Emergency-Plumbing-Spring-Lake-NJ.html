<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to express the intensity of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Co2 will potentially add to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
