<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Service in Palos Verdes Peninsula</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>We can also help if you need garbage disposal repair. One of our specialists will come to your home to discover the problem and get your disposal operating in no time at all.
