<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
