If a clogged storm drain is not resolved in a timely manner, the opportunities are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>You might be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save money. While this may work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your home, indicating that trouble could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
