<p>Supply of water by the public utility includes some quantities of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead.

<p>Some homeowners may think about water softeners as a high-end product, something that's great to have" but not completely required. However, tough water can cause whatever from minor inconveniences, like areas on meals or soap scum, to major problems like a much shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other important home devices.
