<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>

<h3>Bathtub Drain Replacement in Lake Elsinore California</h2>
<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
