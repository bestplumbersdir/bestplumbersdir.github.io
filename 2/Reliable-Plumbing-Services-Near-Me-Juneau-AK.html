These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to remove.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
