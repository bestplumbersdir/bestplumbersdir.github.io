<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
