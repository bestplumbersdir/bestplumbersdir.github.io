Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check".

Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
