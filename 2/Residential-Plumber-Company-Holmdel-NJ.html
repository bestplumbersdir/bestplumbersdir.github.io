<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
