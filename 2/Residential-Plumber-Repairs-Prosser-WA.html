<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.
