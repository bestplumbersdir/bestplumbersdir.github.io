If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Waynesboro PA</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
