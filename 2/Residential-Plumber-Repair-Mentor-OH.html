For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
