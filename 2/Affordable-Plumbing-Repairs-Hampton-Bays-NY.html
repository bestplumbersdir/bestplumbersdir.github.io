<h3>Leaky Faucet Repair in Hampton Bays New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
