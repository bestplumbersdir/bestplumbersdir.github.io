<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually proper, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, changing one out or installing a brand-new one is a relatively easy task.

<p>Inside the house, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Check below sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced estimate price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I examined around. Under the sink, place a bucket or pan underneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix.

TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and recognize issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically beneficial in locating an issue.</p>
