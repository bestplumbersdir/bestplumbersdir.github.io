Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
