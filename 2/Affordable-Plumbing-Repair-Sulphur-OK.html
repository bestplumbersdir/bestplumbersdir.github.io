<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
