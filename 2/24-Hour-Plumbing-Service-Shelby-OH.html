<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indication of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you call a certified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your home. Raw sewage is really dangerous and can pose major health dangers.</p>
<p>When used in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as a result imply that the level of security on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>
