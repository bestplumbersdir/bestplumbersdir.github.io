<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and duty are exceptionally important to building a reputation for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
