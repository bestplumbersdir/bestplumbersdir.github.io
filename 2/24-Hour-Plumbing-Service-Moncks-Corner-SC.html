<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
