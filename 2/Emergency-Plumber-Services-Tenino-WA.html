<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. Unplug the disposal, or, if it's hard-wired, disconnect the electrical circuitry to get rid of the disposal completely.

<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually directed elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

Anticipated to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are created to be effective and resilient, withstanding corrosion and other typical problems that can afflict other pipeline material types.</p>
<p>5. Put hot water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a bit of hot water.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
