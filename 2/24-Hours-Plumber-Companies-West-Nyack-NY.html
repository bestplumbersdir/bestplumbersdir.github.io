<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a severe problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is necessary that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is very dangerous and can pose serious health threats.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with waste disposal unit installation make the task potentially dangerous.
