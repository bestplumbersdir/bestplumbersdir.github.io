<p>Inspecting the water, age, and condition lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers understand numerous things, consisting of water pressure and indications of leakages. If the water heater has been maintained with yearly flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic service warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>
