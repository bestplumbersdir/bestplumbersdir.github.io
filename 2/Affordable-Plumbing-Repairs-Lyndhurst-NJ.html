<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
