<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Statesville NC 28625</h3>
<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
