<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
