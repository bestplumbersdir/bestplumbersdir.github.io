Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.

I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
