<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become trapped in between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will eventually block the circulation of your water before triggering a clog. Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary items are flushed, a clog can happen. Thermostat problems: The thermostat controls the temperature level of the water heater. You may be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this part malfunctions.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
