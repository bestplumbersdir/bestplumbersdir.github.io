<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing sufficient water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any offered source to achieve their objective, however fire department vehicles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the general public supply of water.</p>
