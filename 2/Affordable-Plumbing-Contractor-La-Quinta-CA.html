<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
