In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
