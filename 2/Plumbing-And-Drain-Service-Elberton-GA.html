<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can assist reduce those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot.
