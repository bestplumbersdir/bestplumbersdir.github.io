<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Have non-testable" backflow devices replaced at the intervals described above. Have testable" backflow assemblies checked yearly and rebuilt or replaced as required (normally every 5-8 years). From small repairs to intricate replacements, you can depend on our family-owned and -operated organisation to look after your plumbing whether it's an emergency or set up maintenance.
