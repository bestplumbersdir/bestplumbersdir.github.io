However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
