<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction result and draw possible pollutants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Storage tank hot water heater are typically found in most houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
