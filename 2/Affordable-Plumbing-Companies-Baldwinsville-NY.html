<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
