<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her home.

A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to prevent the reversal of the flow of water once it has passed through the valve. The two kinds of pipes that we prefer to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two really different products, but they both have incredible resilience and durability.</p>
