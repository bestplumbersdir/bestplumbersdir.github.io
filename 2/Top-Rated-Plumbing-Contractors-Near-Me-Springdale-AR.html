The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
