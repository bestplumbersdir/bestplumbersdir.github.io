<p>You are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly needs to meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be discontinued till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>A range of pipe materials are used for entire home repiping, consisting of PEX and copper pipe. The cost varies, depending on the type of product and size of your house. We more than happy to provide estimates for whole house pipe replacement and funding choices are available for large tasks. A pressure vacuum breaker performs the very same function as an atmospheric vacuum breaker, but requires just one system to safeguard the whole water system when installed on the main water line.</p>
