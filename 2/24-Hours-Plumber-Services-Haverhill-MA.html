If your house was built before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was developed years prior to that, opportunities are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at ideal rates.</p>
