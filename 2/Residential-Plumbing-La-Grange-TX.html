<p>A. Using phosphoric acid normally will assist remove them if you have rust spots. , if you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and security cautions first!).

It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and eliminate your old water heater.
