It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
