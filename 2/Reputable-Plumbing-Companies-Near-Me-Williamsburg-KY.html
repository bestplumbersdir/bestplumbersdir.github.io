<p>Each component of the assembly must be evaluated to identify what requires repair.

The overall cost to repair your bathroom or kitchen sink will mostly depend upon the type of problem you're experiencing, any parts needed to repair them, and the degree of the damage to your fixture and plumbing.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.

<p>A strange gurgling noise when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a good indication.
