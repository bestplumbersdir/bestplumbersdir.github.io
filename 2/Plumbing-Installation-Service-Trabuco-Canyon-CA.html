<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water supply.

<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This deterioration can cause a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
