<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, prepare for each device to be set up must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to approve and process.

However while small drips should not be cause for concern, property owners should keep an eye on the hot water heater leaks.

He also did the job faster than initial approximated, so the work was less costly than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>

The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
