<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted need to have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
