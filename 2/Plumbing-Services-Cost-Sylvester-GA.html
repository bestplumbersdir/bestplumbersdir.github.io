<h3>Toilet Installation in Sylvester Georgia</h2>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided excellent service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts. Not just was he comprehensive and exceptionally professional but he was able to respond to all my questions concerning the service. I would provide 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most reliable ways of finding the precise whereabouts of a plumbing issue. A plumber will place a specifically developed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video to identify where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair needs can be resolved reasonably quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, nevertheless, parts of a drain might need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared before being changed. Sometimes, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is necessary (like a reducer, tailpiece, or pvc  trap) to guarantee regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
