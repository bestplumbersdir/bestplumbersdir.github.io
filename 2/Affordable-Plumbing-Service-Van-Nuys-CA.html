<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public supply of water and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of protection for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
