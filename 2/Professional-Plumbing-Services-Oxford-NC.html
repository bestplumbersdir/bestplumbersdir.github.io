<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
