<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils.
