<p>When they have to suit local water and sewer capacities, Garbage disposal systems may cost more.

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
