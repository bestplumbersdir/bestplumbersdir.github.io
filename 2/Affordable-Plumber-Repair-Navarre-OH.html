<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
