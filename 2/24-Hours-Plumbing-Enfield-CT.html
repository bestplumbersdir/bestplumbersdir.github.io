<p>Nevertheless, there is one DIY task that isn't standard and is best left to the specialists: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can rapidly end up being complex when handled by someone with little to no experience in plumbing. While it might appear like a project worth taking on, there are numerous factors to avoid taking a DIY technique to a sewer line repair task and rather choose to hire a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
