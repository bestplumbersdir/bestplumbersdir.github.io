<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
