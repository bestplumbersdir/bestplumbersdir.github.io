<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative.

Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
