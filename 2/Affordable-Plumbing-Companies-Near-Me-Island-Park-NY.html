<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its people from the day your sales person walked in here, through all service personel, and now. By the method, this is a great system. Our energy costs are much lower then previously, the airflow is practically undetectable, the air temperature inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures because installation.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most pricey aspects aren't the machinery or materials utilized, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>As the firmness in the water increases, so does the annual cost savings. In a 40-gpg difficult water market, salt savings alone can reach $1,144 each year. Most water looks alike - however inside a clear glass of water there thousands of dissolved minerals which are totally unnoticeable to your naked eye. One glass of faucet water can have a high content of minerals - another glass of faucet water can have a low content of minerals.</p>
