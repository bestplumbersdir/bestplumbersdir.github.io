<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
