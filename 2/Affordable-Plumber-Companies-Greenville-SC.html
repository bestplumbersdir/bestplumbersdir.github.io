<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the option is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the problem. Other times a more substantial service is needed: repiping.</p>

It enables considerable energy cost savings and an unlimited supply of hot water. Adios cold showers! We install, repair and service all brands available at rates our competitors can't touch.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
