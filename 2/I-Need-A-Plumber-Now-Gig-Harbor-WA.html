<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but hardly ever stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
