<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must meet or exceed the state standards and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
