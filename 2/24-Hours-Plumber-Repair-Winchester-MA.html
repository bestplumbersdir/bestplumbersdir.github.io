Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
