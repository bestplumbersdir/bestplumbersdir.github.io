Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
