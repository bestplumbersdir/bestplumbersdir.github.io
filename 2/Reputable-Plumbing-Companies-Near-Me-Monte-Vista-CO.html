<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
