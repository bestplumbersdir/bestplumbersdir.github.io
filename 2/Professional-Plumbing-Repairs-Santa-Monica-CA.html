<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they typically contain grease and fat.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
