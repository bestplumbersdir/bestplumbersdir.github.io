<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>Frequently triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
