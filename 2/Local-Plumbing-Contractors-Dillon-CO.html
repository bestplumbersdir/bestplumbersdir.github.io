<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
