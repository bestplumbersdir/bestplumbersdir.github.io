Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.

These products gather in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at completion of its lifespan, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
