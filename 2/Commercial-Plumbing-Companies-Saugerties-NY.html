<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
