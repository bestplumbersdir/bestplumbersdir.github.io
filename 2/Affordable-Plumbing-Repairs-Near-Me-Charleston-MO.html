<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. A lot of folks replace their water heaters due to bad performance, total failure or as a preventive measure. If your water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about replacing it with a more effective design. Water on the floor can imply used parts.
