<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Framingham MA</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can avoid these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas a smell often related to rotten eggs. This distinctive fragrance enables you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
