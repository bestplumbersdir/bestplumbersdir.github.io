<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
