<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Low Dangers: For low hazards including fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts check detector and double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and atmospheric vacuum breakers as types of protection.

Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>
