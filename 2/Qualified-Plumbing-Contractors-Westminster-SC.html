Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job because of the age of your house and area of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of backflow systems: air space (AG) and lowered pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a lot of water. In truth, it's an amount that can send out a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're depending on a out-of-date or broken  hot water heater.</p>
