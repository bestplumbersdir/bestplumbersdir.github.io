<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indication of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage odor in your home, it is important that you call a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is really unsafe and can posture major health risks.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater extremely rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
