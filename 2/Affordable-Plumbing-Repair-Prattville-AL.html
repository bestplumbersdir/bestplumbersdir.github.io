<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
