<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
