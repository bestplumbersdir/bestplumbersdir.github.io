<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.
