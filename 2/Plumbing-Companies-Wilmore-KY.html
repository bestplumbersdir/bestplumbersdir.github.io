<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see however hardly ever stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
