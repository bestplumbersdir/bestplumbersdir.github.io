<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leakages and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the pipe and the material flowing through it. This repair technique is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection supplies inspection services for all commercial and commercial buildings, and verifies compliance with the electrical code.
