<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
