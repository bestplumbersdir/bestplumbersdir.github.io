<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
