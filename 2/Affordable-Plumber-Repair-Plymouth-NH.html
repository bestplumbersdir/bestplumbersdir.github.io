The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
