<p>Backflow is a prospective problem in a water supply because it can spread out polluted water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection in between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable pollutants or contaminants to go into the drinkable water system. Sickness can arise from ingesting water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use an element that warms up water when the tap is switched on.
