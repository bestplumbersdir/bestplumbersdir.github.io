<p>Lots of house owners think their energy companies or homeowners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in most cases you, the homeowner, are accountable. A lot of standard house owners insurance policies and local utility companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out yearly forward circulation tests are sometimes perceived as a required to have them. However the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
