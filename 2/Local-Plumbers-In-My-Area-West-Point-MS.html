<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
